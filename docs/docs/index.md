# Introduction

kdef aims to provide an easy way to manage resources in a Kafka cluster by having them defined explicitly in a human-readable format.
Changes to resource definitions can be reviewed like code and applied to a cluster.

kdef was designed to support being run in a CI-CD environment, allowing teams to manage Kafka resource definitions in source control with pull requests (GitOps).
